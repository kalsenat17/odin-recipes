        <h2 class="ca">Description</h2>
            <p>If pork chops and beef steaks are the only chops you sear, 
            it's time to try lamb chops. Lamb chops have a distinctively 
            rich and savory flavor, and while they're fancy enough for a 
            dinner party, quick-cooking lamb chops also add variety to weeknight 
            meals.</p>

        <h2 class="ca">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 lamb loin or rib chops (1-inch thick)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves, plus 1 large sprig</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
                <li>1 small shallot, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 large garlic clove, smashed</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dry white wine or low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="ca">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the lamb chops from the refrigerator and massage the chopped thyme, 
                    1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper into the meat. Set the lamb chops aside 
                    at room temperature for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    Add the lamb chops and cook until a rich, brown crust forms on the bottom, 
                    4 to 6 minutes (if you're using thicker lamb chops, this could take up to 
                    10 minutes).</li>
                <li>Flip the lamb chops and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer 
                    inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 145Â°F, 4 to 6 minutes 
                    more.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the shallot, garlic, and thyme sprig to the pan 
                    and cook until shallot softens and begins to brown, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Deglaze with the wine or broth and lemon juice, scraping any browned bits 
                    from the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Cook until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, 
                    remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons butter. Cook until the butter 
                    melts and the sauce thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Taste and season with 
                    more salt and pepper if needed. Pour the sauce over the lamb chops and serve 
                    immediately.</li>
            </ol>
