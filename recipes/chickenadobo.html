                <li>3 tablespoons palm sugar (50g)

                <li>Rice for serving</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, add in all the chicken 
                    (thighs and drumsticks) and the heavily 
                    crushed cloves of garlic
                </li>
                <li>To that add a fresh crack of black pepper, 
                    black peppercorns, palm sugar, unseasoned 
                    rice vinegar, dark soy sauce, regular soy 
                    sauce, filtered water, and toss together 
                    and add in bay leaves.
                </li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the 
                    fridge for 2 hours, or ideally overnight. 
                    **Reserve all marinated liquid**
                </li>
                <li>Set a large braiser or dutch oven over medium-high 
                    heat and coat with oil to cover the pan
                </li>
                <li>Sear all the chicken in batches on all sides for 2-3 
                    minutes per side. Place each batch to the side once 
                    done browning to avoid overcrowding.
                </li>
                <li>Add marination to the pan (without the chicken) along 
                    with all the aromatics. Increase the heat to medium-high 
                    and add the chicken pieces to the pan in layers and bring 
                    to a boil.
                </li>
                <li>Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let 
                    simmer (covered) for 35 minutes. Uncover and flip the 
                    chicken pieces, cover them again, and cook for another 
                    25-35 more minutes. Turn chicken over occasionally to 
                    thoroughly coat and the sauce thickens and a glaze.
                </li>
                <li>Place the chicken on a plate of rice topped with green 
                    onions. Spoon on as much sauce as desired.
                </li>
            </ol>
